        <h2>What is Live Baccarat?</h2>
        <p>Live Baccarat is one of the most popular live dealer games, bringing the real casino experience to your screen through high-definition video streaming.</p>
        
        <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
        <p>The goal of Baccarat is to predict which hand will have a point value closer to 9: the Banker or the Player.</p>
        
        <h2>Betting Options</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Player Bet</strong>: Pays 1:1</li>
          <li><strong>Banker Bet</strong>: Pays 1:1 (minus 5% commission)</li>
          <li><strong>Tie Bet</strong>: Pays 8:1 or 9:1</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Winning Strategies</h2>
        <p>While Baccarat is primarily a game of chance, understanding the odds and bankroll management can enhance your gaming experience.</p>

        <h2>Live Roulette Betting Systems</h2>
        <p>Betting systems are strategic methods players use to manage their bet amounts.</p>
        
        <h2>Martingale System</h2>
        <p>Double your bet after each loss until you win. This is one of the simplest but also riskiest systems.</p>
        
        <h2>Fibonacci System</h2>
        <p>Adjust bet amounts according to the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...), more conservative than Martingale.</p>
        
        <h2>Important Notes</h2>
        <p>No system can guarantee wins. Always play responsibly and set budget limits.</p>
